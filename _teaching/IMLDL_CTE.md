I was the mentor for the course conducted by [Center for Technical Education](https://bpgc-cte.org/) during Spring, 2019. As a part of this course, I mentored over 200 students in machine learning and deep learning. I took doubt sessions and moderating and evaluated assignments as and reference material as a part of this course.
