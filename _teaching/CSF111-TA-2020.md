I was the teaching assistant for the graded course CSF111, conducted by Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences (January 2020 - July 2020). This is a 4-unit course with a lab component for first-year candidates. As a teaching assistant, we mentored over 1000 students, solved their doubts related to general programming in C and Shell, conducted and evaluated labs as a part of the college curriculum.
