I am an Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx) and am pursuing a Computer Science major. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing, and Adversarial Machine Learning**, along with exploring *Computational Neuroscience, Bayesian Statistics, and Bias in Machine Learning*.

I am currently a research intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) Labs. I am working with automatic text scoring systems alongside pursuing my research on Indian languages with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems). Previously I was a data science intern at [My Smart Price](https://www.mysmartprice.com) and worked on rule-based recommendation engines. I am also interested in competitive programming, web development, and play casual chess.
