I am currently a research intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/){:target="_blank"} Labs. I am working in the areas of Language, morphology and Speech and pursuing my research on Indian languages with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems){:target="_blank"}. Previously I was a data science intern at [My Smart Price](https://www.mysmartprice.com){:target="_blank"} and worked on rule-based recommendation engines. I am also interested in competitive programming, web development, and play casual chess [someshsingh22](https://www.chess.com/member/someshsingh22).
