I am an Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx) and am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My field of research is **Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing, Discrete Math and Graph Theory**. I am extensively exploring the areas of *Natural Language Understanding, Adversarial Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Semantic Evaluation, and Bias in Natural Language Processing*.

Currently I am a research and development intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) Labs, I work on adversarial Machine Learning. I am working on sentiment analysis with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems) and am working on [DecepticoNLP](https://github.com/SforAiDl/decepticonlp), an open source library to test NLP systems with adversarial examples and robust training for NLP Systems.

Currently I am also a remote intern at [My Smart Price](https://www.mysmartprice.com) and am working on rule based Recommendation engines.
I am also a competitive programming enthusiast and am a Purple coder on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/someshsingh22) and Specialist on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/someshsingh22).

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, I also share a keen interest in Computational Neuroscience Cross-Cultural Studies and Social Research I am presenting a paper on Impact Evaluation for Enhanced Educational Outcomes under the Humanities Department and presenting it at the International Conference On Teaching and Rehabilitation Of The Deaf, IIT Roorkee.

I use this blog to present all my research, publications and tutorials from scratch.
