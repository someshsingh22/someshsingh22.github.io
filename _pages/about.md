I am a Senior Year Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} and am pursuing a Computer Science major. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing, Adversarial Machine Learning, Speech Processing, and Cognitive Neuroscience**.

I am a Data Science Intern at [CommerceIQ](https://www.commerceiq.ai/) where I will be working on advertisement optimization on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart.

I am currently a research intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/){:target="_blank"} Labs. I am working with automatic text scoring systems, and investigating effects of morphology on Transformers and biases in machine learning, alongside pursuing my research on Indian languages with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems){:target="_blank"}. Previously I was a data science intern at [MySmartPrice](https://www.mysmartprice.com){:target="_blank"} and worked on rule-based recommendation engines. 

I have been the events and initiatives head at [CTE](https://bpgc-cte.org/){:target="_blank"}, Lead [LRG](http://lrg.saidl.in/){:target="_blank"}, and am also interested in competitive programming, web development, and playing casual chess.
