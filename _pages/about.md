I am an Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx) and am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My field of research is **Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing, Discrete Math and, Graph Theory**. I am extensively exploring the areas of *Natural Language Understanding, Adversarial Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Semantic Evaluation, and Bias in Natural Language Processing*.

Currently, I am a research and development intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) Labs, I work on adversarial Machine Learning. I am  also working on sentiment analysis with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems). I am also the lead developer of [DecepticoNLP](https://github.com/SforAiDl/decepticonlp), an open-source library to generate adversarial examples for robust training of NLP systems.

I am a remote intern at [My Smart Price](https://www.mysmartprice.com) and am working on rule-based Recommendation engines and
am also interested in competitive programming, and Web Development.

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, Cross-Cultural Studies and, Social Research I am presenting a paper on Impact Evaluation for Enhanced Educational Outcomes under the Humanities Department and presenting it at the International Conference On Teaching and Rehabilitation Of The Deaf, IIT Roorkee.

I use this blog to present all my research, publications and tutorials from scratch.
