I am an Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx) and am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My field of research is **Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing, Discrete Math and Graph Theory**. I am extensively exploring the areas of *Natural Language Understanding, Semantic Evaluation, Bias in Natural Language Processing and Adversial Attacks on NLP and Speech Processing systems*.

Currently I am submitting a Research Paper in [SemEval-2020 Task-11](https://propaganda.qcri.org/semeval2020-task11/) on sequence labeling and multi-classification on a highly granular task and working on a few research projects under the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems).


I am also a competitive programming enthusiast and am a Purple coder on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/someshsingh22) and Specialist on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/someshsingh22).

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, I also share a keen interest in Cross-Cultural Studies and Social Research I am presenting a paper on Impact Evaluation for Enhanced Educational Outcomes under the Humanities Department and presenting it at the International Conference On Teaching and Rehabilitation Of The Deaf, IIT Roorkee.

I use this blog to present all my research, publications and tutorials from scratch.
