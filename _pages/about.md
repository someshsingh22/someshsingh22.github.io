I am an Undergraduate at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx) and am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing, Discrete Math, and Graph Theory**. I am extensively exploring *Natural Language Understanding, Adversarial Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Semantic Evaluation, and Bias in Natural Language Processing*.

I am a research and development intern at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) Labs, and I work on adversarial Machine Learning. I am  also working on sentiment analysis with the [CS Department, BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ComputerScienceInformationsSystems/ComputerScienceandInformationSystems). I am also the lead developer of [DecepticoNLP](https://github.com/SforAiDl/decepticonlp), an open-source library to generate adversarial examples for robust training of NLP systems. Previously, I was a remote intern at [My Smart Price](https://www.mysmartprice.com) and am working on rule-based Recommendation engines. I am also interested in competitive programming, and web development and social research.
