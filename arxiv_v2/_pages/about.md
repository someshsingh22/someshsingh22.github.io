I love research at the intersection of human behaviour and machine learning. With over 100 billion individuals shaping our world, each life leaves a unique trajectory paved by “decisions” and “randomness”, ultimately influencing our preferences or “behaviour” towards things, people, or even self.

At the heart of my research lies a deep desire to comprehend human behaviour and decision-making intricacies. I recognize that every step we take is not merely random but driven by a striving nature, as observed through the lens of Darwinism. This realization captivates me, on my quest to decipher the underlying patterns that shape our “behaviour” and “decisions”.

Embracing my role as a researcher at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/){:target="_blank"}, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to our understanding of the human mind. I strive to contribute to our collective knowledge of human behaviour by linking psychology, marketing, and machine learning. Currently, my research focuses on human psychology (emotions, memorability, content and behaviour) in the context of digital experience with computational models like LLMs.

Previously, I completed my BE Computer Science (Hons.) at [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx){:target="_blank"} with a minor in Data Science, my undergraduate thesis on Content Analytics and Causal ML was advised and mentored by [Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8iUBg8AAAAJ&hl=en) @[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) @[IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Tirtharaj Dash](https://tirtharajdash.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Veeky Baths](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/veeky/profile){:target="_blank"} @ [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
