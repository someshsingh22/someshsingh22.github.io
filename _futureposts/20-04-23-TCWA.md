This is the first post in this series where we learn to build a Reddit flair classifier from scratch! In this part, we will scrape the data from Reddit, based on given time, extraction frequency, and a lot more! We will not use the PRAW API because it limits our search results.

The data extractor extracts posts from a wide time period to eliminate the Bias towards some hot topics.
* You can save and load your progress at checkpoints too (especially useful for online collection and storage),  
* All logs are made in crawler.log, warnings are displayed.
* To optimize space removed, empty flairs are removed batch wise.

We will use the pushlift.io API instead to make calls and extract JSON packages.
