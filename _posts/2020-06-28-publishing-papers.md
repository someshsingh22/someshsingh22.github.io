Publishing is a very critical component for a researcher to must embrace and support the other researchers life and to advance the scientific age. Publications are a form of expression and communication in academia. With this blog I will iterate through the various important stages of working in research and getting a successful publication.

## Selecting The Research Problem
Select topics that you feel are relevant and challenging, tired of a lot of propaganda in the news? Work on locating and classifying propaganda in text!
Focus on a limited and relevant subject and avoid topics that have less scope or resources.

## Literature Review
Be very thorough with your literature review; it will reveal previous results, avoid redundant work, plagiarism, and let you know the research gaps and the potential solution.
Read and evaluate your literature thoroughly, maintain notes, and gather the relevant information with full bibliographical details.
## Find a better solution - An incremental Approach.
In most cases, your work will not be entirely new; most of the academia proceeds with incremental work. Try to assess the research gaps you found in your review and work on their solutions or enhancements.
Formulate your story and hypothesis as you conduct your experiments. Your work should stand on its own as a piece of literature and should answer all the questions about the topic.
## Writing the paper
Your paper should stand out on its own, explain any assumption that you may have made, and all the references for your work, always create a first draft and build on that. Comply strictly to the pattern followed by your journal/conference, and often papers are rejected just because they did not comply with the format strictly.
## Find a Conference / Journal (Journal vs. Conference)
Journals take a lot of time in general and are supposed to have a higher impact factor. Still, conferences have quicker feedbacks and are interactive.
