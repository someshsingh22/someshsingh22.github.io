Welcome fellow traveler on this road to research !

### Disclaimer
There is no Shortcut / Perfect path to research or publishing a paper. There will be a lot of times where I may tell you to follow this pattern, to do this and avoid that yet there will be counter-examples everywhere. But since we are on a journey together I would make this story flavoured with my experiences and opinions. (Feedback is as welcome !)

### First Steps
Look around yourself, explore the environment of countless possibilities, as these are your first steps do not feel afraid of faltering - Get to know your interests, before I got interested in Machine Learning, I looked a bit into Data Structures and Algorithms and some basic web development. Read the recent advancements of the fields, find what genuinely attracts you and start identifying the research problems.
